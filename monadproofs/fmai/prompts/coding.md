# General Background
This is a Coq programming task. First, some general guidelines about Coq programming tasks.

## Admitting holes (defer less critical/important parts)
Complex Coq programs are often written incrementally. 
Coq allows us to "admit" helper functions temporarily so that they can be defined later.
However, in that case, you need to come up with the type of the helper function. 
For example, you admit a helper function to convert a Z to a String.string, as follows:

```coq
Definition Ztostring (z: Z) : String.string. Admitted. (* TOFIXLATER *)
```
This mechanism allows you to get the higher-level details right before implementing the low-level obvious details.
Do not forget the "TOFIXLATER" comment, as this will be used to find the holes to fill in later.

Sometimes you cannot leave some holes for later because that may jeopardize Coq's termination checker for recursive functions, or the hole may need to be defined simultaneously with what you are currently defining. These issues are explained later in this tutorial.

## Error Messages
You are talking to an automated bot that will process your responses. 
If the Coq program you emit has errors, this bot will respond with the errors emitted by Coq.
Here are some general tips to avoid errors:
1. Use qualified names to avoid conflicts
2. Do not make any assumptions about which notation scopes are open. For example, if you mean `Z.add 1 2`, write `(1+2)%Z` instead.

## Coq Vernacular Queries instead of Hallucinations
If you are not sure about the exact name of a definition/fixpoint/inductive in the standard library or the libraries available to you can issue Coq queries to get more information about the available context. Some of the widely used queries are `Search`/`About`/`Check`/`Locate`. Here are some examples of search:

Search (nat -> nat). (* search the library for items of type nat -> nat *)

Search (nat -> list ?a -> list ?a). (* unification variables can be used to constrain occurrences: e.g. here the 2 occurrences of ?a must match the same term *)


Search "add". (* Search all definitions whose name contains "add" *)

Search (nat -> nat -> nat) "add" -"mul". (* Search all functions of type nat->nat and exclude functions whose names contain "add" but not "mul" *)

About Nat.add (* show documentation for an item *)

Check (Nat.add 1 1). (* check type of a term *)

Locate nat. (* print the possible fully qualified name(s) of `nat`. unless the user defined their own `nat` type, this will print `Corelib.Init.Datatypes.nat` . this will print multiple items if there are several items whose fully qualified names have `nat` as the leaf, e.g. `A.nat`, `Corelib.Init.Datatypes.nat`. It would also print shorter names for each fully qualified name. The shorter name depends on the set and order of Imports in the current file. When writing Coq code, you should refer to the located item by a name not any shorter than the shorter name mentioned here: the longer the better as that is robust to moving code around where the order of imports are different. *)

`Search`: can return too many items unless you chose a fairly discriminative query.
However, don't use the `Search ... in module` syntax which only searches in a particular module: instead, search in all modules by not specifying the `in` part.

Queries other than `Locate` need the references to definitions/inductives to be sufficiently qualified depending on the set of `Import`s. For example, you may need to say `A.foo` instead of just `foo` if you havent `Import`ed A. You can can use `Locate` to figure out the missing qualifications.

## Structural Recursion
Beyond the minor surface-level sytax differences, one of the main differences between Coq and other functional programming languages like Ocaml/Haskell is that functions must terminate for every possible argument(s). For example, functions of type `nat -> nat` cannot recurse forever. To ensure that, Coq follows a very simple approach, which unfortunately can make life harder for programmers.
For any `Fixpoint` definition, Coq must identify one argument that is decreasing in all recursive calls to the function being defined.
That argument must be of an `Inductive` type. A term `a` of an Inductive type `I` is a structural subterm of another term `b` if `a` is obtained by peeling off one or more constructors of the type `I`, possibly after computational reductions on open terms.

For example, a function to compute sum of a list of numbers can be defined as:
```gallina
Fixpoint listsum (l: list nat) : nat :=
  match l with
  | [] => 0
  | h::tl => h + listsum tl
  end.
```
The recursive call is on `tl` which is a structural subterm of `h::tl` which is the first argument (`l`). 

In contrast, the following definition, which is logically equivalent and also terminating, is not allowed by Coq:

```gallina
Fixpoint listsum (l: list nat) : nat :=
  match l with
  | [] => 0
  | h::tl => h + listsum (rev tl)
  end.
(*
Error:
Recursive definition of listsum is ill-formed.
In environment
listsum : list nat → nat
l : list nat
h : nat
tl : list nat
Recursive call to listsum has principal argument equal to "rev tl" instead of "tl".
Recursive definition is: "λ l : list nat, match l with
                                          | [] => 0
                                          | h :: tl => h + listsum (rev tl)
                                          end".
*)
```
`rev tl` is not a *structural* subterm of `h::tl`.

### Nested Inductives
Constructor arguments of some inductive types can themselves be of Inductive types, e.g. the last (`children`) argument below of the `node` constructor:
```gallina
Inductive Tree (T:Type) : Type :=
| node : T -> list (Tree T) (* children *) -> Tree T
| empty : Tree T.

Arguments node {_} _ _. (* make the T argument implicit *)
Arguments empty {_}. (* make the T argument implicit *)

```

In such cases, Coq allows us to define nested recursive functions, e.g.
```gallina
Fixpoint sum (t: Tree nat) : nat :=
  match t with
  | empty => 0
  | node nodeVal children => nodeVal + list_sum (List.map sum children)
  end.
```
Coq unfolds the definition of List.map, which is itself a structurally recursive function, to observe that `sum` is only 
called on subterms of `children` which itself is a subterm of `node nodeVal children`.
More concretely, Coq expands `nodeVal + list_sum (List.map sum children)` in the definition of `sum` to:
```gallina
nodeVal + list_sum ((fix map (l : list (Tree nat)) : list nat := match l with
                                                                   | [] => []
                                                                   | a :: l0 => sum a :: map l0
                                                                   end) children)
```
and then observes the only recursive call is on `a`, which is a subterm of `children`.

This unfolding of `List.map` is essential for Coq to figure out that this is valid structural recursion. 
If List.map were opaque or an `Axiom`, Coq would not be able to figure that out and Coq would reject that definition.
Thus, when leaving out admitted holes in the strategy in the previous section, please be mindful to not leave out holes around the recursive calls.

### Well-founded recursion
Coq provides the `Program Fixpoint` mechanism to workaround the rather restrictive syntactic criteria above. With `Program Fixpoint`
a user can define an arbitrary measure function but then Coq asks the user to prove that all recursive calls are on an argument with a smaller measure. You are already aware of this mechanism but you tend to overuse it. 
`Program Fixpoint` is not a primitive construct in Coq. Instead it encodes the user-supplied recursive function into a typicall 100x larger function that actually does *structural recursion* on proofs of measure decrements. Functions defined using `Program Fixpoint` often do not reduce well or at all, especially when the proof of measure reduction in recursive call arguments are opaque or have opaque subterms.
`Program Fixpoint` does prove unfolding equational lemmas (propositional equality) but that is not as convenient as reduction (definitional equality). So only `Program Fixpoint` if a structurally recursive formulation would be much much more complex.
Definitely PREFER IMPLEMENTING ADMITTED HOLES if they get in the way of Coq seeing structural recursion, instead of switching to `Program Fixpoint`.



## Mutual Inductives and Fixpoints (recursion)
If you want to define a function that recurses on inductive data, you typically use the `Fixpoint` keyword. If the inductive type is mutually indutive with other types, often the needed recursion is also mutually recursive. In such cases, you need to define your function using mutual Fixpoints. Below is an exampe:

```gallina
Inductive Expr : Type :=
| EConst : nat -> Expr
| EAdd : Expr -> Expr -> Expr
| ELet : string -> Com -> Expr -> Expr

with Com : Type :=
| CSkip : Com
| CAssign : string -> Expr -> Com
| CSeq : Com -> Com -> Com
| CIf : Expr -> Com -> Com -> Com.


Definition env := string -> nat.

(* Update environment *)
Definition update (ρ : env) (x : string) (v : nat) : env :=
  fun y => if String.eqb x y then v else ρ y.
  
Fixpoint eval_expr (ρ : env) (e : Expr) : nat :=
  match e with
  | EConst n => n
  | EAdd e1 e2 => eval_expr ρ e1 + eval_expr ρ e2
  | ELet x c e' =>
      let ρ' := eval_com ρ c in
      eval_expr ρ' e'
  end

with eval_com (ρ : env) (c : Com) : env :=
  match c with
  | CSkip => ρ
  | CAssign x e => update ρ x (eval_expr ρ e)
  | CSeq c1 c2 => let ρ' := eval_com ρ c1 in eval_com ρ' c2
  | CIf e c1 c2 =>
      if Nat.eqb (eval_expr ρ e) 0 then eval_com ρ c2 else eval_com ρ c1
  end.
```
In the above example, `eval_expr` calls `eval_com` (`ELet` case) and `eval_com` calls `eval_expr` (`CAssign` case).
Thus, neither of these functions can be defined before the other and they need to be defined together, using mutual recursion.
WHILE DECIDING WHAT TO LEAVE ADMITTED FOR LATER, ENSURE THAT WHAT YOU DECIDE TO LEAVE FOR LATER DOESNT NEED TO BE DEFINED MUTUALLY RECURSIVELY WITH WHAT YOU ARE CURRENTLY DEFINING.

## Common mistakes

In Coq, string escaping works non-intuitively. 
You would expect the following to define a string containing just the double quote character.

```gallina
Definition doubleQuote : String.string := "\"".
```

But that is not valid Coq syntax. Instead, the following works:
```gallina
Definition doubleQuote : String.string := """".
Compute (String.length doubleQuote). (* returns 1 *)
```
If this is confusing, you can just add the above `doubleQuote` definition and use it
when producing strings.
