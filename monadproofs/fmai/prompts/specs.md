# Separation Logic Specs of C++ functions

The current task may involve writing separation logic specs of C++ functions.
This section explains some custom Coq notations we have developed for writing specs of C++ functions in Coq.
Consider a very simple C++ function foo:

## A simple spec example
```c++
using uint = unsigned int;

uint x = 0;
uint y;

void foo() {
    y=0;
    y=x+1;
}
```

Here's its spec in Gallina in our framework:

```gallina
Notation uint := "unsigned int"%cpp_type.

  cpp.spec "foo()" as foo_spec with (
        \pre{xv:Z} _global "x" |-> primR uint (cQp.mut (1/2)) xv (* forall xv .. *)
        \pre _global "y" |-> anyR uint (cQp.mut 1)
        \post _global "y" |-> primR uint (cQp.mut 1) ((xv+1) `mod` (2^32))%N ** _global "x" |-> primR uint (cQp.mut (1/2))  xv
      ).
```

`cpp.spec` is an elpi-wrapper that creates a regular Gallina `Definition` of `foo_spec` and also declares some typeclass instances that our proof automation can use to find specs. In this case, it produces the following definition:


```gallina
Definition foo_spec : mpred :=
  specify {| info_name := "foo()"; info_type := tFunction "void" [] |}
        (\pre{xv:Z} _global "x" |-> primR uint (cQp.mut (1/2)) xv (* forall xv .. *)
        \pre _global "y" |-> anyR uint (cQp.mut 1)
        \post _global "y" |-> primR uint (cQp.mut 1) ((xv+1) `mod` (2^32))%N ** _global "x" |-> primR uint (cQp.mut (1/2))  xv).
```

`cpp.spec` automatically finds out the type of the c++ function and populates the `info_type` record element.
In `tFunction "void" []`, the first argument is the return type of `foo` and the list is the types of arguments.
We have cpp2v, a clang-ast-visitor tool that converts c++ ASTs to Gallina, as an element of type `translation_unit`:.

```gallina
Record translation_unit : Type := {
  symbols : symbol_table;
  types : type_table;
  initializer : InitializerBlock;
  byte_order  : endian;
}.
```
`cpp.spec` looks for a variable in `Context` of type `translation_unit` and finds the type there.
`cpp.spec` also detects some common mistakes in specs so we use it instead of writing the `Definition` directly.
The general syntax of `cpp.spec` is:
```gallina
cpp.spec [fully_qualified_cpp_function_name] as [gallina_defn_name] with ([spec]).
```

`spec` should be of type `WpSpec mpred val val`. `WpSpec` is a compex record type and we do not construct its elements by directly. Instead, we use notations like `\pre` `\post` which construct the appropriate record. 
Lets look at the spec part of `foo_spec` above, which I have reproduced below.
```gallina
  (\pre{xv:Z} _global "x" |-> primR uint (cQp.mut (1/2)) xv (* forall xv .. *)
   \pre _global "y" |-> anyR uint (cQp.mut 1)
   \post _global "y" |-> primR uint (cQp.mut 1) ((xv+1) `mod` (2^32))%N ** _global "x" |-> primR uint (cQp.mut (1/2))  xv).
```

The first 2 lines specify 2 preconditions of the function and the last line specifies the postcondition. In general, a spec is just a precondition and postcondition. Multiple assertions can be combined using separation logic's `**` into a single precondition. However, for more readability, we can write different conjuncts in separate lines using the `pre` notation repeatedly in each line.

Let's look at the second line, which is the simpler precondition:
```gallina
   \pre _global "y" |-> anyR uint (cQp.mut 1)
```
It asserts full ownership of the memory location for the global variable `"y"`.
But it does not at all constrain the value that is stored at the variable `y`.
Infact, it allows `y` to be unitialized.
C++ semantics requires memory locations being read to be initialized but `foo` only writes to `y`. 
Writing to uninitialized memory locations is fine. Below is a formal characterization of `anyR`:

```gallina
Lemma anyR_iff : 
  (_global "y" |-> uninitR uint 1 \\// (Exists xv:Z, _global "y" |-> primR uint 1 xv))
  -|-  _global "y" |-> anyR uint 1.
Proof. 
  rewrite bi.or_alt. go.
  ren_hyp t bool.
  destruct t; go. 
Qed.
```

Now look at the first precondition in `foo_spec`:

```gallina
\pre{xv:Z} _global "x" |-> primR uint (cQp.mut (1/2)) xv (* forall xv .. *)
```
`\pre` can be followed curly braces containing variable quantifications. 
These variables are universally quantified over the entire spec.
In other words, the caller of the function gets to choose any well-typed instantiation of these variables.
This precondition says that the memory location for the global variable `"x"` has the value `xv`, which is a Gallina variable (not a c++ variable). The type of `xv` is the familiar `Z` (`Corelib.Numbers.BinNums.Z`) from the Coq standard library.
This precondition also asserts `1/2` ownership over the memory location. 
Because `foo()` only reads the memory location, any (positive) fraction suffices. 
Later, we will see a generalized variant of foo_spec.
Now look at the postcondition:
```
   \post _global "y" |-> primR uint (cQp.mut 1) (((xv+1) `mod` (2^32))%N `mod` (2^32))%N ** _global "x" |-> primR uint (cQp.mut (1/2))  xv).
```
The second conjunct `_global "x" |-> primR uint (cQp.mut (1/2))  xv` is exactly the same as the precondition: `foo()` doesnt change the variable `x` and doesnt store or pass any fraction of the ownership of `x` to another thread, so it returns back the entire ownership of `x`.
Similarly `foo()` returns back the entire (`1`) ownership of `y`, but changes the value of `y` to `xv+1`, as specified by the first conjunct `_global "y" |-> primR uint (cQp.mut 1) ((xv+1) `mod` (2^32))%N ** _global "x"`.

### variants of the above spec

First, lets formally see that meaning of multiple `\pre`s: they are equivalent to combining them by `**`. For example, the above spec is equivalent to the following which is often considered less readable.
```gallina
  cpp.spec "foo()" as foo_spec with (
        \pre{xv:Z} _global "x" |-> primR uint (cQp.mut (1/2)) xv ** _global "y" |-> anyR uint (cQp.mut 1)
        \post _global "y" |-> primR uint (cQp.mut 1) ((xv+1) `mod` (2^32))%N ** _global "x" |-> primR uint (cQp.mut (1/2))  xv
      ).
```

We have notations to make specs less verbose. For example, the conjunct `_global "x" |-> primR uint (cQp.mut (1/2))  xv` was both a precondition and a postcondition. We can use `\prepost` to equivalently write such conjuncts only once:
```gallina
  cpp.spec "foo()" as foo_spec with (
        \prepost{xv:Z} _global "x" |-> primR uint (cQp.mut (1/2)) xv (* this is both a precondition and a postcondition *)
        \pre _global "y" |-> anyR uint (cQp.mut 1)
        \post _global "y" |-> primR uint (cQp.mut 1) ((xv+1) `mod` (2^32))%N
      ).
```

Finally, lets see a stronger spec where the precondition is weakened by generalizing the onwership fraction `(1/2)` to an arbitrary positive rational number (type `Qp`, which is a Gallina type defined by the stdpp library distributed by iris developers (`stdpp.numbers.Qp`)).
Qp has regular arithmetic operations/notations like +, /, * defined. Use `Qp` as the scope delimiting key to use these notations, 
e.g. (1/2+1/3)%Qp.

```gallina
    cpp.spec "foo()" as foo_spec with (
        \prepost{(xv:Z) (q:Qp)} _global "x" |-> primR uint (cQp.mut q) xv (* this is both a precondition and a postcondition *)
        \pre _global "y" |-> anyR uint (cQp.mut 1)
        \post _global "y" |-> primR uint (cQp.mut 1) ((xv+1) `mod` (2^32))%N
      ).
```
Note that there can be multiple variable quantifications in curly braces but they need to put in parentheses, just as one would do in Gallina after `forall` e.g, `forall (n:nat) (m:nat), 0<=n+m`.

## Specs involving pointer variables

Consider the function `fooptr` below:
```c++
int a = 0;
int *cptr;

void fooptr () {
    cptr = &a;
}
```

`fooptr` has the following spec:

```gallina
  cpp.spec "fooptr()" as ptrspec with
      (\pre _global "cptr" |-> anyR "int*" 1
       \post _global "cptr" |-> primR "int*" 1 (Vptr (_global "a")) 
      ).
```
Both the the precondition an the postcondition assert full (`1`) ownership of the (C++) global variable `cptr` of type `int*`.
The precondition allows that variable to contain any value or even be uninitialized.
The postcondition guarantees that `cptr` has the value that is the memory location of the (C++) global variable `a`.

## Specs of functions receiving arguments and returning values

Consider the simple twice function below, which accepts arguments and returns a value.
```c++
uint twice (uint x) {return 2*x;}
```

Here is a very simple but very weak spec, but illustrates how to capture arguments and return values in specs:
```gallina
  cpp.spec "twice(unsigned int)" as twice_weak_spec with (
     \arg "x" (Vint 1)
     \post [Vint 2] emp
      ).
```
The first line of the core spec (`\arg "x" (Vint 1)`) says that the there is one argument, whose C++ name is `x` and its value is assumed to be `Vint 1` as a precondition.
The last argument of `\arg` must be of type `val`.
Similarly, after `\post`, we can specify the returned value of type `val` in square brackets. So, in `\post [Vint 2] emp`, `[Vint 2]` says that the function returns `2`, assuming then precondition are true. the last argument of `\post` must be a separation logic assertion (of type `mpred`) formally representing the postcondition of the function.
`emp: mpred` denotes empty ownership. It is the left/right identity element of separating conjunction (`**`), just like `True:Prop` is the identity element of regular logical conjunction in classical/intuitionistic logics (`Prop`).
In fact, `emp:mpred` can be defined as `[| True |]`.
In this case, the function `twice` is not passed in any external ownership and does not return any ownership: the argument is passed by value and and the result is returned by value. Later, we will see cases where arguments are passed by reference and in such cases, external ownership is passed in as a precondition and returned as a postcondition.

Before that, lets make the spec more general. The only change we need is to generalize over the `1` in `\arg "x" (Vint 1)` to an arbitrary universally quantified number.
Just like `\pre`, `\arg` can have universally quantified variables in curly braces:

```gallina
  cpp.spec "twice(unsigned int)" as twice_spec with (
     \arg{xv:Z} "x" (Vint xv)
     \post [Vint ((xv*2) `mod` (2^32))] emp
      ).
```
Now the precondition is relaxed to allow passing
any non-negative integer as an argument.
Even though the spec, as written, doesnt say that `xv` is non-negative,
the way we have defined semantics of function calls allows the proof of this spec to assume `(0<=xv<2^32)`. This allows the spec to be less verbose and avoid mentioning the conditions on the `val` (last) argument of `arg` imposed by its type.

[TODO: Print the exact Coq defnition that is implicitly plugged in]

Even the `\post` keyword allows variable quantification. 
This is useful when we do not want the caller to assume know the exact returned value or when the returned value is non-deterministic.
For example, lets weaken the spec above to weaken the postcondition to merely say that the returned value is even and not guarantee anything else: 

```gallina
  cpp.spec "twice(unsigned int)" as twice_weak_spec2 with (
     \arg{xv:Z} "x" (Vint xv)
     \post{xvfinal} [Vint xvfinal] [| xvfinal `mod` 2 = 0 |]
      ).
```
This spec would make more sense if the function had name `someEvenNumberBasedOn` rather than `twice`.


## Specs of functions passing arguments by reference

`doubleInPlace` is similar to `twice` except the the argument is passed by reference and the result is stored in the same place.
```c++
void doubleInPlace (uint & x) {x=2*x;}
```
Below is its spec.

```gallina
  cpp.spec "doubleInPlace(unsigned int &)" as doubleInPlace_spec with (
     \arg{xloc:ptr} "x" (Vptr xloc)
     \pre{xv:Z} xloc |-> primR "unsigned int" (cQp.mut 1) (Vint xv)
     \post xloc |-> primR "unsigned int" (cQp.mut 1) (Vint ((xv*2) `mod` (2^32)))
      ).
```
Unlike in `twice(unsigned int)`, the argument now contains not an integer value but a memory location, say `xloc`.
In the C++ axiomatization, an argument passed by reference is similar to an argument passed as a pointer.
The `\pre` line then asserts full (1) ownership of `xloc` and asserts that it contains a primitive integer, say `xv`.
The postcondition returns all that ownership of `xloc` but asserts the updated (twice) value.
