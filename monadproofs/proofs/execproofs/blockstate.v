Monad is a new L1 blockchain that can execute EVM-compative transactions much faster.
The C++ class `monad::AccountState` stores the state of an account while a transaction is being executed.
We need to write `AccountStateR`, its Rep predicate.
First, we need to find an appropriate Gallina model for `monad::AccountState`.
A possibility is to use `monad.EVMOpSem.block.block_account`, which is a type that comes from Yoichi's EVM semantics defined in Coq (via Lem) in 2018. However, this type just represents an account state before the execution of a block.
The C++ class has more fields, which may be only relevant during the execution transaction.
Some of them maybe in the `EVMOpSem.evm.variable_ctx` Record in the Gallina EVM semantics.
This Record is used in the step function of EVM in the semantics in Gallina.

Monad executes transactions of a block with optimisic concurrency.
The validate_exact_balance_ field denotes whethere the transaction has done some action (e.g. BALANCE opcode) that requires the pre-tx balance to be an exact value instead of just being >= min_balance for the speculative execution to not be invalidated by previous concurrent transactions. Use `AssumptionExactness` as a model of those fields: min_balance only makes sense if validate_exact_balance_ is false.

`AccountStateR` should take arguments of type cQp.t, block.block_account, AssumptionExactness,  and perhaps also evm.variable_ctx.
AccountState has a baseclass and includes monad::Account. you will need to define Rep predicates for these as well.
block.block_account and/or evm.variable_ctx may serve as appropriate model types for those as well. The logical information from block.block_account and/or evm.variable_ctx seems to be split across the fields of those 3 classes.
TRY VERY VERY HARD TO FIND THE MODELS OF THE C++ FIELDS IN block.block_account and evm.variable_ctx. YOU MUST NOT ADD A SEPARATE MODEL ARGUMENT FOR ANY FIELD WHICH ALREADY HAS A MODEL IN THOSE GALLINA RECORDS. block.block_account has the balance/nonce info to serve as the model for those fields in `monad::Account` class.

Below are some existing Rep predicates that you can use (in addition to the ones mentioned in the general spec background above):
- IncarnationR is the existing Rep predicate for the c++ class `monad::Incarnation`.
- bytes32R for `bytes32_t` (alias for `evmc::bytes32`).
- u256t for `uint256_t` (alias for `intx::uint<256>`)
- addressR is the Rep predicate for Address (alias for `evmc::address`)

Many of these Rep predicates are currently admitted. You dont need to define them. But their type will tell you the Gallina models of these types.
Unfortunately, there is currently no way to search the Coq context for Rep predicate definitions/axioms for a given C++ type.
So, if a Rep predicate for a class has not been mentioned in this first prompt, you can assume it doesnt exist and you need to define it.
You can admit a `MapR` for the storage_ field: but you still need to figure out an appropriate type for MapR. Do not bother to define it generically for the templated Map type: just focus on the concrete instantiation.
