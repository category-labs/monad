(*
bluerock.lang.cpp.syntax.stmt.Stmt, an Inductive type I have defined for C++ statements.
`bluerock.lang.cpp.syntax.stmt.Stmt` is defined mutually Inductively with many other types like `Expr`.
Write a set of mutually recursive pretty-printer functions for all such types.
These Gallina functions should return `string`.
In the current context, `string` refers to `PrimString.string`, which is unusual in non-recent Coq developments. 
PrimString.string is a new type in Coq's core standard library. It axiomatizes primitive strings.
The scope delimiting key for  PrimString.string is pstring.
So, `(a ++ b)%pstring` appends `a:PrimString.string` and `b:PrimString.string`.
PrimString.string is different from Stdlib.Strings.String.string, which is the type of the non-primitive strings that have been in the Coq stdlib for decades. Stdlib.Strings.String.string is slower so I avoid using it in this application where speed is important.
